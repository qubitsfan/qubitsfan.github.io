                        <p>
                            I am currently a master student in Quantum Science & Technology program in <a href="https://www.tum.de/">Technical University of Munich</a>. 
                            At 2022, I obtained the Bachelor's Degree in Physics (Atomic and Molecular Physics) in 
                            <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China</a>.
                            During the undergraduate education, I've been mainly involved in the quantum simulation and computation on <b>Trapped Ions</b>,
                            including Cs-VQE on water molecule and discrete time crystals. At 2021, I also did some projects on <b>Atom Chips</b> 
                            for internship at <a href="http://english.siom.cas.cn/">Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics</a>.
                            Now I am quite interested in quantum computation and relevant NISQ algorithms on <b>Circuit QED</b> and eager to discover further.

                           Variational Quanutm Eigensolvers (VQE) algorithm is one of the algorithms applied on the 
                           noisy-intermediate scale quantum processors. It includes quantum
                           processing units to prepare ansatz states to be mearsured, and classical processing
                           units to implement classical algorithms to optimize parameters when preparing ansatz states.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                            A typical VQE algorithm is to solve the ground state of a certain molecule in quantum chemistry.
                            The Hamiltonian of the system can be decomposed to sum of tensor products of local Pauli operators.
                            \[ \hat{H} = \hat{H}_1 + \hat{H}_2 + \cdots + \hat{H}_N\]
                            VQE is to prepare a universal state in the given Hilbert space by some universal parameters 
                            \(\vec{\theta}=(\theta_1, \theta_2, ..., \theta_k)\)
                            and repeat to get each of the expectation values \(\langle \hat{H}_i\rangle \), then sum them up to get
                            \(\langle \hat{H} (\vec{\theta})\rangle\). Now the problem is transformed to a classical optimization 
                            problem, which can be solved efficiently via classical algorithms or algorithms from machine learning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                            But beyond the typical VQE algorithms, Contexual Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver is from
                            the idea that one can solve this problem efficiently in classical methods when the hamiltonian is 
                            noncontextual. For tensor products of Pauli operators in noncontexual Hamiltonian, it can be expressed as 
                            product of some basic terms, where the terms are in the set \(Z \cup C_1 \cup C_2 \cup \cdots\cup C_k\). 
                            Here terms in Z commute with any terms in this set, while the terms in any of C set commute with terms
                            in the same C set but anticommute with terms in other C sets. Due to the structure of noncontexual Hamiltonian,
                            one can find the least terms in the set with corresponding quantum numbers of the system, and then to classically
                            find the ground energy of the system by optimizing quantum numbers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                            However, contexual problem is not as easy as noncontexual Hamiltonian to be solved just with classical resource.
                            But we can reduces the cost of quantum reource by restricting our system into the subsystem of original Hilbert space. 
                            That is what we called Contextual Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolvers Algorithm, leading to reduction 
                            of numbers of qubis and costs of quantum computing resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                            Thus, we separate the whole system into  noncontextual part and contexual part.
                            \[ \hat{H} = \hat{H}_c + \hat{H}_{nc} \]
                            For noncontexual part, one can construct corresponding quantum number to simulate it classically. Actually, the number 
                            of terms to be simulated classicaly in determines the dimensions of noncontexual subspace of the given problem. (One 
                            can reconsider this claim by transforming these terms into \(\hat{\sigma}_z\) or equivalently stabilizer space.)
                            When we reduce the number of terms in noncontextual part, contexual space can be released and be computed by typical 
                            variational quantum eigensolver algorthms, without any contradictions to results in unrealised contextual part. 
                        </p>

                            In my Bachelor's thesis, I've clarrified Cs-VQE algorithm and performed it onto solving the ground state of water 
                            molecule, where I designed a typical circuits by means of single-qubit and two-qubits gates of trapped ions. 
                            At last, I simulated designed quantum circuit for 7 qubits in Qiskit reaching the result with 0.4 H.a. error.

                            is also one of the most widely used geometric phase gate on trapped ions.

                            Considering a chain of N trapped ions interacting a pair of bichromatic light (detuning \(\pm(\omega_k +\mu\)), 
                            phase \(\phi_r + \phi_b = \pi\)), the bichromatic Hamiltonian is
                            \[
                            H_{MS}=\sum_i\sum_{k=1}^N\Omega_i\eta_{i,k}\cos(\mu t - \phi_i^m)(\hat{a}_k e^{-i\omega_k t}+\hat{a}_k^\dagger e^{i\omega_k t})
                            \hat{\sigma}_{x}^i
                            \]

                            By means of Magnus formula, we can obtain the time evolution operator under Hamiltonian
                            \[
                            \begin{aligned}
                            \hat{U}(\tau) 
                            &= \exp [- i \int_0^\tau dt \hat{H}_{MS}(t) - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^\tau dt_2 \int_0^{t_2} dt_1 [\hat{H}_{MS}(t_2), \hat{H}_{MS}(t_1)]] \\
                            &=\exp[\sum_i\sum_{k=1}^N(\alpha_{i,k}(\tau)\hat{a}_k^\dagger+\alpha_{i,k}^*(\tau)\hat{a}_k)\hat{\sigma}_x^i+i\sum_{i,j}\chi_{i,j}(\tau)\hat{\sigma}_x^i\hat{\sigma}_x^j]            
                            \end{aligned}              
                            \]

                            Here the single spin operators part indicates a time-dependent displacement operator acts on phonon parts with eigenvalue \(\alpha_i^k(\tau)\)
                            , including all of the vibration modes of the ion chain. The double spin operators term indicates the accumulation of a geometric phase \(\chi_{i,j}(\tau)\)
                            between two typical trapped ions. This spin-spin interaction term could be used to implement C-NOT gate in trapped ions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                            However, with the growing number of trapped ions, frequencies of different vibrational modes will get closer, leading to residual excitation
                            to other vibrational modes, which is a barrier for improving fidelity of the gate. Here the gate pulse shaping technique is introduced to 
                            design the shpae of the laser pule to optimally control the evolution of vibrational modes as dynamical decoupling. 
                            \[
                            \begin{equation}
                            \Omega_i(t) = \Omega(t) = \left\{
                            \begin{aligned}
                            & \Omega_1 \quad 0 < t \leq \tau / P \\ 
                            & \Omega_2 \quad \tau / P < t \leq 2\tau / P \\ 
                            & \cdots \\
                            & \Omega_P \quad (P - 1)\tau / P < t \leq \tau \\ 
                            \end{aligned}
                            \right.
                            \end{equation}
                            \]

                            After that, one can rewrite the accumulating phase \(\chi_{i,j}(\tau)\) and fidelity of the gate \(\mathcal{F}\) into matrix form 
                            by considering the rabi frequency as a vector \(\symbf{\Omega}\). Then problem is transformed to an classical optimization
                            \[
                            \left \{
                            \begin{aligned}
                            &\chi_{ij}(\tau) = \symbf{\Omega}^T D^{ij} \symbf{\Omega} \neq 0 \\
                            &\min_{\symbf{\Omega}} (1 - \mathcal{F}) = \symbf{\Omega}^T B \symbf{\Omega}
                            \end{aligned}
                            \right .
                            \]

                            This problem is a typical constrained optimization, which can be solved effeciently with Lagrange multiplier.

                        <p>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                            For ultracold atoms experiments, it's necessary to use MOT to trap atoms by 3 pairs of light with different polarizations
                            and a pair of coils to generate magnetic trap. Alternatively, we can use the reflection of light on the surface of the chip to 
                            reduce the number of necessary polarized light to 4. 
                            Also, we can use the nanostructure on the chip to generate correspongding quadrature magnetic trap insted of giant coils. 
                            This kind of simplification to MOT, which is atom chip, provides a possibilities in trap atoms in a small-scale device.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                            But due to nanostructure on the chip, there are some constraints on currents to protect the wires from melting. 
                            There exists two potentially destructive patterns on melting of the wire. 
                            Once the circuit is working for a long time, the heat from current will accmulate and lead the rise of temperature. 
                            When temperature is higher than the melting temperature, the wire is broken, which gives the upper limit of power-on time. 
                            Another constraint comes from the the instantaneous high current from releasing of electrons in the chip, which gives the 
                            upper limit of current. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            To reach these two requirments, I've designed and revisited a protecting circuit including a integrator circuit and several
                            comparators. Here the integrator circuit is to integrate input signal with time untiil the output signal exceeds the setting 
                            voltage, which shorts the wires on the chip and beeps as a warning signal. So the time for current can be controlled under 
                            such circuit. Besides, the comparators will monitor the peak value of current, which guarantees the maxmium value of value
                            in case of instantaneous releasing of electrons.

                            The 2D lateral effect position-sensing detectors, PDP90A by thorlabs, provides an accurate way to measure positions
                            of light by voltages collected from 4 anodes from corners of the detecting area, namely A, B, C & D.
                        </p> 
                        <p>

                            The 2D lateral effect PSD behaves the same as photondiodes, with a bias cathode to generate photoncurrent in revearse bias regime.
                            This PSD has a resistive layer on both the anode and cathode photodiode connections so the photoncurent can be transformed into voltage
                            signals. The typical 5 output voltage signals are \(\Delta x = (A+D)-(B+C)\),\(\Delta y = (A+B)-(C+D)\) & \(SUM = (A+B+C+D)\). 
                            One can find the information of x and y positions of light by considering the symmetry of the structure with 
                            \[
                            x = \frac{L_x}{2} \times \frac{(A+D)-(B+C)}{A+B+C+D} = \frac{L_x \Delta x}{2 SUM}
                            \]
                            \[
                            y = \frac{L_y}{2} \times \frac{(A+B)-(C+D)}{A+B+C+D} = \frac{L_y \Delta y}{2 SUM}

                            Thus, I designed a paradigm PCB for the double-channel dividing circuit using the operational amplifier and processed
                            real displacement of beam to the center of sensor by dividing output signals. After that, I welded the circuit board independently 
                            and packaged the whole electronic system to realize signal division module.

                            At last, I analyzed and compared processed output signals with real displacements, which is at least 99.8% linear relevant with 1.032 scale factor.
