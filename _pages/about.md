I am currently a master student enrolled in Quantum Science & Technology program in [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and work in [Walther-Meißner-Institut](https://www.wmi.badw.de) about subharmonic driving of a single Fluxonium. 

At 2022, I obtained the Bachelor's Degree in Physics (Atomic and Molecular Physics) in [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), graduated from [School of the Gifted Young](http://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/).
During the undergraduate education, I've been mainly involved in the quantum simulation and computation on **Trapped Ions**, including Cs-VQE on water molecule and discrete time crystals. 

At 2021, I also did some projects on **Atom Chips** for internship at [Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics](http://english.siom.cas.cn/).

Now I am quite interested in quantum computation on **Circuit QED**, and eager to discover further in novel alternative qubits Fluxoniums as well as multi-qubit gates.
